# reproduce-interference-between-librealsense2-and-mvviewer

This repository was originally created to reproduce an issue on Ubuntu 22.04 involving interference between [librealsense2](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) and [MVviewer-SDK](https://www.irayple.com/en/serviceSupport/downloadCenter/18?p=17).

# Resolution

The issue has been fixed in the [MVviewer_Ver2.4.2.9_Linux_x86_Build20240923.run](https://github.com/sakurai-ryuhei/reproduce-interference-between-librealsense2-and-mvviewer/releases/download/v0.0.0/MVviewer_Ver2.4.2.9_Linux_x86_Build20240923.run), and both libraries now work together without any crashes. The original program and workflow that reproduced the issue are still available for reference.
